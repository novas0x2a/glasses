This is Glasses. It's a program to aid in computer vision studies. Aid in
vision. Glasses. Get it? Here are the things you need, and the versions I
tested with.

sdl     (1.2.12)
sdl-ttf (2.0.9)
g++     (4.1.2, 4.2.0)
GNU make (> 3.81)

You might need linux, but in theory, the staticfile support shouldn't need it

Implement the VideoDevice interface for your camera if you don't have a V4L
one. That'd be sweet. I'm aiming for some level of cross-platform stuff here. I
doubt it will compile with vc++, though. Type 'make' to compile. It might need
gnu make. The makefile uses SECONDEXPANSION, which requires gnu make >= 3.81.

Keys:

s) Dump the current screen to shotX.ppm, where X is the lowest unsigned integer
   for which a shot does not already exist.
q) Exit

There's a lot left to do. I'm releasing this now because it'll encourage me to
keep working on it. Right now, filters must be fixed at compile time, and there
can only be one filter per frame.

Everything in here is covered by the GPL v2.
