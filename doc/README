How do you run it? Okay, so.. it's still a little rough. There's no way to
define filter chains in a config file or something, so you have to change code
to do so. The filters are in filters.cc, and they are used in main.cc

As for sources, you can either read from a V4L1 character device or a 24bpp ppm
You can create one by hitting s while glasses is running, or you can create an
RGB image in gimp/photoshop and save it as a raw ppm. If you create it in the
gimp, though, make sure you remove the stupid comment that gimp adds to the
second line (that restriction will go away when I put in a real image-reading
library).

For more information on the ppm format, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_pixmap. I'm looking for a P6 type.
