This is Glasses. It's a program to aid in computer vision studies. Aid in
vision. Glasses. Get it? Here are the things you need, and the versions I
tested with.

sdl     (1.2.12)
sdl-ttf (2.0.9)
g++     (4.1.2, 4.2.0)
linux   (for now, until more camera interfaces are implemented)
V4L camera

Implement the VideoDevice interface for your camera if you don't have a V4L
one. That'd be sweet. I'm aiming for cross-platform stuff here. I doubt it will
compile with vc++, though. It will probably compile with ICC, Intel's
proprietary compiler.

The default setup shows (left-to-right, top-to-bottom):
0) Current camera view
1) Invert
2) Replace-blue. This uses the average of the red and green channels to replace
   the blue channel.
3) Red     channel
4) Green   channel
5) Blue    channel
6) Cyan    channel
7) Magenta channel
8) Yellow  channel

Keys:

s) Dump the current screen to shotX.ppm, where X is the lowest unsigned integer
   for which a shot does not already exist.

There's a lot left to do. I'm releasing this now because it'll encourage me to
keep working on it. Right now, filters must be fixed at compile time, and there
can only be one filter per frame. There isn't a good way for filters to draw
text and such on their frames. Lots left to do.

Everything in here is covered by the GPL v2.
